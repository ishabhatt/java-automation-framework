# Design Principles Documentation

## 1. Framework Architecture Overview

- **Modular Structure**: Organized into `pages`, `tests`, `utils`, `base`, and `testdata`.
- **Maven Integration**: Centralized dependency management and build lifecycle.
- **TestNG**: Used for test execution, configuration, and parallelization.
- **Dockerized Runs**: Enables consistent test runs across environments.

## 2. Design Patterns Implemented

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Encapsulates UI elements and actions in dedicated classes.
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamically creates and provides page object instances.
- **Singleton Pattern**: WebDriver instance management throughout the test lifecycle.
- **Base Class Pattern**: Common setup and teardown for all test classes.

## 3. Best Practices

- **Logging (Log4j2)**: Captures actions and errors in detail for diagnostics.
- **Screenshot on Failure**: Auto-captures UI state during test failure.
- **Clean Code Structure**: Organized into base, utility, page, and test layers.
- **Reusable Utility Classes**: Includes wait handlers, property readers, etc.

## 4. Data-Driven Testing

- **Data Providers**: Uses `@DataProvider` for parameterized tests.
- **External Files**: Reads data from CSV, JSON, or Excel in `testdata/`.

## 5. CI/CD and Test Execution

- **CI Ready**: Runs `mvn test` in pipelines for automated validation.
- **Docker Compose**: Supports parallel, scalable execution using Docker services.
